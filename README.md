# Modern Responsive Website

Hey there! 😊

This is a fully responsive website I built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
No frameworks, no templates — just clean structure, styling, and interactive behavior built from scratch.

Everything is built with core web technologies to strengthen my fundamentals.
